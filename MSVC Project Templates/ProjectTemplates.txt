Project Template .ZIP Files
---------------------------

The .zip files in this directory are Microsoft Visual C++ Project Templates. 

With these templates, you can start projects using Sagebox easily, all set up to compile and work with Sagebox. 

Also see the file "CreatingProjects.rtf" in the root project directory for more information about setting up 
projects using the Sagebox libraries. 

Copying the Project Templates
-----------------------------

The .ZIP files are used as-is by Microsoft Visual Studio to load a project.  These can be copied into the directory:

	\users\<your user account>\Documents\Visual Studio 2019\Templates

Load Projects
-------------

Once copied, when you invoke "Create Project" in Microsoft Visual Studio, these .ZIP files will come up.

You will see either a green cube with "C++" on the cube to denote a Sagebox Project Template, or a Blue/Teal
cube to denote an Advanced form of the template that contains streamlined code with no comments are initial code. 


The .ZIP Project Templates
--------------------------

	Sagebox C++ -- Console Mode and Windows Project Template.zip
	------------------------------------------------------------

	This template is the main base template.  This allows you to create Console-Mode or Windows program with
	a project setting.  The WinMain() is created for you, and it calls your main() function automatically, where you
        can then write your program as a procedural program or event-driven program, as a Windows or Console-Mode program,
	both, or a mixture.

	This template also includes optimized project settings for faster code, and debug settings so you can debug your program
	with the visual debugger.

	Win32 and x64 can also be used in each project setting.

	note: Although this provides a WinMain() function, you can provide your own be removing the reference to WinMain.obj
	in the project -- when this is removed, you can use your own WinMain().  Otherwise, see the documentation below on the 
	.ZIP template "Sagebox C++ -- Windows Project Template.zip", which is a Windows-only version of this template, without
	the supplied WinMain() or Console-Mode project settings.



	Sagebox C++ -- Console Mode Windows Project Template (Clean).zip
	----------------------------------------------------------------

	This is the advanced version (blue cube) of the previous template.  It is exactly the same, except that 
	the code has no comments or initial code, making the project template clean and ready to go.  

	This is meant for more adbvanced or general usage where you no longer want or need the initial code and comments
	in the previous template.



	Sagebox C++ -- Windows Project Template.zip
	-------------------------------------------

	This is a Windows-only version of the previous templates.  It includes the optimized, debug, x32, and
	x64 project settings, but does not support console mode. 

	This template is provided for when you want to supply your own WinMain() or wWinMain() function.  The 
	previous templates include the WinMain() which calls your main() automatically.	

	Sagebox C++ -- Sandbox Project Template (Console Mode and Windows).zip
	----------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is a very quick template for jumping into creative and casual programming with Sagebox.  The template 
	places the start code into a sub-classed window, allowing you to program more like console-mode programming 
	but with the power of Windows and Sagebox functions.

	More will be written about this as more documentation and examples are written for Sagebox.
