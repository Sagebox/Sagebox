About My Projects Directory 
---------------------------

The My Projects Directory can be used to instantly create and run programs using Sagebox.

You can load any of the Sagebox templates and use them in a project created in this directory.  
There is a sample project included in the directory. 

You can use this directory for your projects, or as a quick way to try out and get used to using the 
Sagebox library tools.

From the "Visual Studio Projects" directory .zip files (or by exporting any of the projects there), 
you can create a project in this directory with all of the paths and libraries already set up for usage. 

-------------------------
Basic Directory Structure
-------------------------

    The basic structure for the provided project templates is to have the Sagebox include, lib, and 
    optionally, the Widgets directory at the same level as your main project or solution parent 
    directory, such as in this diagram:

	Top Directory (Where your projects' parent directory is located), with directories:

                --> include                      (Sagebox Includes)
                --> lib                          (Sagebox libraries) 
                --> Widgets                      (Sagebox Widgets) (optional)
                --> My Projects
                        └─── Your Project #1     (Your project directory)
                        └─── Your Project #2     (Your project directory)

    The directories "My Projects\Your Project #1" and "My Projects\Your Project #2" are where your 
    solution (.sln) or project (.vcxproj) files reside.  "My Projects" is the parent directory at
    the same directory level as the Sagebox include, lib, and Widgets directories.


-----------------------------------------------
Using Sagebox in other directories and projects
-----------------------------------------------

As noted in the ReadMe files for the projects, you can also do one of the following:

      1. Use the SageboxRoot macro in the provided property page, setting SageboxRoot 
         to the path of the where Sagebox was downloaded (i.e. the directories that have the
         "include" and "lib" directories

         Imporant Note: Make sure to set the property page in "Wiidows->Other->Property Pages"
         rather than editing the propery page in the project directly.

      2. use "#include "<path to Sagebox>\CSagebox.h", and then specify the library Sagebox.lib
         (x32 or x64) directly (or QuickCpp.lib, if a Sage Quick C++ program) with "#pragma comment(lib,<path>). 
        
See the documentation on Adding Sagebox to Existing or New Projects for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Include, Lib, and Widgets directories in My Projects Directory
--------------------------------------------------------------

The include, lib, and Widgets directories in the My Project Directory are direct copies of the same
directories in the Sagebox project root directory.  They are duplicated here to make the project templates work correctly.
