---------------------------------------
Creating or Adding Sagebox to a Project
---------------------------------------

Sagebox projects are standard C++ Console Mode or Windows projects, either 32-bits (Win32) or 64 -bits (x64). 

--> Requirements

    The only requirements for compiling Sagebox are the following:

        1. #include "CSagebox.h"
        2. The library Sagebox.lib


--> Adding Sagebox to an Existing  Project

    All Sagebox projects are just basic applications, either Console Mode or Windows.  Sagebox is simply a library that
    is used and can be added to any existing C++ project, Console or Windows.

    There are only two lines needed to add Sagebox to an existing project, either Windows or Console Mode

        1. Include "CSagebox.h"
    
           such as "#include "c:\Sagebox\include\CSagebox.h".  All of the other include files should be included automatically.

        2. Include the library Sagebox.lib into the project or source code. 

           The library Sagebox.lib must be included from the Sagebox lib\x32 or lib\x64 library, depending on whether your
           project is Win32 or x64.  See the project templates that include the processor extension appropriate to the project 
           etting using macros. 

           You can include the library in your project, or use the following #pragma in your source code. For example, if the 
           Sagebox root directory is at "c:\sagebox\git", the following is all you need to add Sagebox to your code:

               #include "c:\sagebox\git\include\CSagebox.h"
               #pragma comment(lib,"c:\\sagebox\\git\\lib\\x32\\Sagebox.lib")

           The #pragma is not needed if the library is added to the project configuration (i.e. link configuration).  
           
        Note: "lib\x64" is used for 64-bit applications.
           
        Once either of these steps is completed, Sagebox is ready to go.  
           
        note: Quickcpp.lib and CQuickCpp.h are used inplace of Sagebox.lib and CSagebox.h, respectively, when using 
        the "Quick C++" project (see the Experimental directory in the Visual Studio Project Templates directory)


------------------------------------
Creating a New Project Using Sagebox
------------------------------------

--> Using Project Templates

    The directory "Visual Studio Project Templates" has project templates that can be loaded into Microsoft Visual Studio.

    The .zip files can be put into the Template directory that will then come up when you start a new project. 
    
    Otherwise, you can load one of the template projects and then export it to a filename of your choosing; then you can 
    load it as a project template. 


--> Creating a New Project with Console Mode or Windows 

    Since all Sagebox projects are just basic applications, either Console Mode or Windows, you can create a standard/empty C++
    project with Micrsoft Visual Studio, and then add Sagebox easily. 

    Create either a Win32/Win64 Console Mode or Windows project, and then follow the instructions above regarding adding Sagebox
    to an existing project. 

    Note: you can add the library WinMain.lib to create a Windows program that will call main() instead of WinMain() -- this
    allows easy switching between Console App and Windows App with no code changes. 

    See the project template "Console Mode (and Windows)"  in the "Visual Studio Projects Templates" directory for more 
    information.
