SageBox 3D Interactive Cube Demonstration
*****************************************

This program draws a 3-D cube that can be rotated with the mouse and sized up/down with the mousehweel.

The program also puts specular highlights on the cube as it is rotated. 

This shows how SageBox can be used for graphics programs and more complex math.
The program is fairly simple, the only extended set of code being the code that calculates the diffusion.

SageBox Features Shown in this Program
---------------------------------------

This program is very short, so just look around and see what SageBox functions are used.  They are usually
self-explanatory and self-documenting.  In most cases, you can hold the mouse over the function and the 
documentation for that function will appear on the screen.

Transparent Controls

 One thing to note is the top text and the checkbox -- when the Cube is enlarged, the backgrounds of these controls are updated
 to blend with the cube that is underneath them.
