Since they are useful tools, the Color Wheel Widget and ColorSelector Widgets are contained natively in the SageBox library. 

You can just include 'CColorWheelWidget', or 'CColorSelector',  which will use the one in the main include.  If you include "Widgets\include\CColorWheelWidget.h", or
"Widgets\include\CColorSelector.h" then you  must also add ColorWheelWidget.lib and CColorSelector.lib, respectively, to your linker input (use all configurations setting).

CColorWheelWidget and CColorSelector are  inside of SageBox is in the Sage:: namespace, and the ones in the Widget directory are in no namepace.  
Therefore, they will not collide with the classes of the same name inside of the Sage namespace.

These are included here for reference, and the source code for CColorSelector, CColorWheelWidget, CDial, cLed, and others will be released as more is release with the
initial version of SageBox.

It is recommended to use the versions of CColorSelector and CColorWheelWidget already in the SageBox library (i.e. these are here just for reference).
