SageBox Mouse Drawing Example
*****************************

This program is a very short program to show how powerful SageBox can be with just a few general SageBox functions, such as
looking for the mouse click, mouse movement, and drawing lines. 

The program itself is about 25 lines, and uses common SageBox function.  That is, its not esoteric and is a good way to
learn how SageBox works.

Colors used in the program are text-based, i.e. "White","Right","LightYellow", etc.  These are stock colors in SageBox.  
Regular RGB values or variable can also be used, such as {0,0,255}, for blue, for example.     In this program, since its
a small demo, stock colors were used for ease-of-use and show how they can be used rather than specific RGB values.

-----------------
Using the program
-----------------

Just draw on the screen!  The colors change automatically.  Right-Click the mouse to clear the screen, and use the Mouse Wheel to increase the
thickness of the lines drawn.
