About Basic Examples
--------------------

The Basic Example short, "Hello World"-level programs meant to show a specific Sagebox item. 

Most examples show two elements of Sagebox, such as the "Mouse Events" that show how Sagebox procedural-
level events work (Sagebox also supports event-driven, as well as a mixture of the two), as well as getting
mouse movements and clicks.  It also shows a small sample of the Quick Dev Cotrols by creating a DevButton.

Some examples have larger versions in the Examples directory, such as the Color Wheel, 3D Mandelbrot, etc.

Note About Widgets
------------------

One of the main elements of Sagebox is the use of Widgets that can be used by any window, either as a separate window o
embedded in the calling window (i.e. parent). 

There are four examples of using Widgets in this directory, as well as expanded usage in the Examples directory.

There will be many Widgets added to Sagebox in the near future.
