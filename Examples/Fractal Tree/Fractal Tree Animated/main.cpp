// Fractal Tree - Animated Version
// -------------------------------
//
// *** This program is written to give an example and lessons in how to use Sagebox.  Therefore, it is heavily commented. ***
// *** This program must be set to write out to an AVI -- Search for bWriteFrames to turn this on.
// 
// Note: Where the two previous project versions (Basic Tree and Fancy Fractal Tree) are good examples of using simple Sagebox 
// controls, this program is an example of creating a small-but-capable program using many Sagebox features.
//
// Individually, all of the Sagebox features used in this example are pretty simple. For the first-time viewer, it may
// seem complicated because there are 10+ different Sagebox elements being used at the same time.  Broken down individually,
// these Sagebox components tend to be relatively simple.   
//
// However, there are some powerful functions used, such as the TextWidget() -- which is easy enough once the 
// basic manner of specifying options with Sagebox is understood.
//
// note: Also note that you can hold the mouse over any Sagebox function or option (in Microsoft Visual Studio) and this
// will popup documentation on the function or option.
//
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The main() code which performs all program duties except displaying the Fractal Tree, is only about 40 lines, 
// but may look larger with the numerous comments explaining the code (try removing the comments) to see how small
// the code is)
//
// This main() function is only 40 lines because of the powerful set of Sagebox tools.  See below for a description
// of some of the Sagebox elements in this program.
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Some Sagebox components used in this program are as follows:
//
//    1. Point3D_t        -- A class used for Point & Vector math.  It is used as a 2-D vector in this program
//    2. CString()        -- A very powerful String class, similar std::string() but with much more power, felxibilty, and speed
//    3. RGbColor         -- A simple RGB class comprised of Red,Green, and Blue, but with powerful functions and expression overloads.
//    4. Window Options   -- In the main AutoWindow call, many options are used.  These are easy to use once the nomenclature is understood. 
//    5. Text Widget      -- Text Widgets are easy to use, but also very expansive.  This program uses some of the more advanced options.
//    6. Dev Window       -- The Dev Window is a very quick and easy way to get controls going for programs where you don't need a formal 
//                           User Interface.  This program uses the Dev Window in some powerful ways
//    7. Inline Text Controls     -- The "{g}" and "{EndFont}" sort of text you see are controls you can give inside of the text
//                                   This gives a way to change fonts, set tab stops, and do other things in inline text.
//    8. Fonts            -- This program creates some fonts with AddFont(), names them, and uses them in inline text.
//                           for example, the font "SmallFont" is used to switch to smaller font just after print the Frame Size,
//                           which is in a Text Widget pre-created with an "Arial 25" font
//    9. Update Background    -- The UpdateBg() call below update the background of the widget, copying the window
//                               beneath.  Since we're animating, this is always changing, and the background are updated just prior
//                               to writing out the frame.
//   10. Manual Update        -- Most of the time, programs can be written in Sagebox with an automatic update. 
//                               But when performing animations or changing graphics, it can be better to turn off the auto-update and
//                               perform it manually.  The NoAutoUpdate() option in AutoWindow() tells Sagebox not to update the window
//                               automatically.  Later, the Update() call updates the window once the Fractal tree has been displayed. 
//   11. Reading & Display Images, etc. -- There are a few more things used here in the Sagebox library that make it easy to use.  For example,
//                                         the main background image is read in and displayed with just 2 lines of code.  If the image is not found
//                                         the display just falls through.  Though this program doesn't check for it (because it doesn't care), it is 
//                                         easy to determine of the read failed by calling a Sagebox function or just checking of the bitmap is empty. 
//
// note: This project is set for Windows Debug, a console-mode program.  This can be a Windows program with 
// a project switch, but was left as a console-mode program because console-mode programs are relatively easy
// to end prematurely (with a Control-C), and is a good development method to use before converting it to Windows.

// Main() -- Animate the Fractal Tree and put it out to an AVI file
//
// This function is fairly simple and is broken down into a few components:
//
// 1. Setting up the DevWindow
//
//    There are a few calls to DevText(), DevWindow(), DevButton(), to set up a dev window.
//    The dev window is used to show the staus and to look for a cancel button press.
//
//    Some fonts are created that are used as controls in text strings to the Dev Window and
//    Dev TextWidgets, to have different font sizes for output. 
//
//     While not necessary, these differnet font sizes make the output look nicer. 

// 2. Drawing The Fractal Tree, Updating Status, and Writing the Frame
//
//    The actual drawing of the Fractal tree is accomplished in one line.  There are a few lines of setup that aren't necessary,
//    but were done to allow experimenting with numbers and clarity about what those numbers mean. 
//
//    The AVI frame is written, and then a line is put out to the Dev Window with information about the current frame.
//
// 3. Closing the AVI and waiting for exit
//
//    When finished, the AVI file is closed (if we we're writing it), and the program waits for the user to close the window.
//    Note that the Cancel Button is never release used.  CButton::SendCloseMessage() is called to tell the button to 
//    send a window-close message when the button is pressed.  Now when CWindow::WaitforClose() is called, it will return
//    when the window is closed by the user or the Cancel Button is pressed.
//
//    This was done just for simplicity -- otherwise, without having called CButton::SendCloseMessage(), we could go into a 
//    GetEvent() loop and look for the button to be pressed. Instead of cWin.WaitforClose(), the line 
//
//              while(GetEvent() && !cCancelButton.Pressed());
//
//    does exactly the same thing.
//
int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{ 

    // Create a window and CSagebox object together.  This is useful when you only want to create a Window
    // and don't need a cSagebo object.  You can obtain the CSagebox object created if necessary.
    //
    // Title()          - sets the name of the window
    // bgGradient()     - clears the background of the window in a gradient with the colors used.
    // NoAutoUpdate()   - Specifies that the window should not update on its own (wait for an Update() call)
    // NoClose()        - Don't send a window-close message when the user presses the window close. 
    //                    (lets us check it ourselves)
    //

    //
    // Note the opt::NoClose() -- when opt:: is specified, Microsoft Visual Studio will give you a list of all available options, so
    // you don't have to remember them all.  
    //
    // opt:: is a namespace that is being used, so NoAutoUpdate() is actually opt::NoAutoUpdate(), and I probably used opt:: because I 
    // wasn't sure of the name I wanted.  Try putting opt:: in the line below for Visual Studio to present you with a list of options you 
    // can send to controls and other functions.

    // to use.  In this case, the returned object isn't saved because we don't need it once we displayed it.
    // With the return object, the TextWidget can be changed.
    //
    // Font()               - sets the font
    // JustBottomCenter()   - sets the text at the bottom in the window, centered. 
    // JustCenterX()        - Centers the text widget in the middle of the X dimension, without changint the specified Y position. 
    // Transparent()        - tells the TextWidget to blend in the background rather than using a solid color.
    // Trnsparent(value)    - Sets the background as transparent, and also tells the Widget to blend the result at
    //                        the value given (for example, Transparent(75) makes the result 75% opaque, and 
    //                        Transparent(25) makes it nearly invisible as 25% opacity (or 75% transparent).
    // AddShadow()          - Adds a shadow to the text in the TextWidget.

    // The first two parameters (X,Y) are zero because JustBottomCenter() sets X and Y itself.
