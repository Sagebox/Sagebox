Quick Description of Templates
------------------------------

The Main Template to use is "Console Mode (and Windows)" (the first one describe below)


--> Console Mode (and Windows)

Creates a standard C++ Console Mode (or Windows C++) starting at main().  The template adds code to create
the CSagbox object and subsquent window. It then adds code to print out Hello World and a circle on the Sagebox Window. 

This template has a "Windows" project setting, turning the program into a Pure Windows program.  It links
with WinMain.lib to transfer control from WinMain() to main(). 

This allows the program to switch back-and-forth between a Console Mode program and Windows program with
no code changes.

--> Windows

This is a Windows version of the Sagebox template starting at WinMain().  It prints "Hello World"
messages to the window and draws a circle. 

It also adds an ExitButton() at the end, since it is a Windows program with no console mode.


--> Experimental - Sagebox Quick C++ Console mode (and Windows)

This is a version of the Console mode (and Windows) template above, but using the Sagebox Quick C++
layer, which creates a static CSagebox object and global window, along with other structures.

This also turns on a number of settings for easier programming.  It can be a way to create quick programs
and prototypes with some extra tools set automatically.
