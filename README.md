# Sagebox
Libraries and Project Templates for Sagebox

Sagebox is a set of C++ utilities and functions designed to make writing C/C++ programs in Windows much simple, fun an creative.

Sagebox comes from a package that I have been using for a long time to write commercial and other professional applications (for example, Sagelight Image Editor (www.sagelighteditor.com). 

I spent the last 8 months creating Sagebox from the original sources, to release a project that can be used by anyone at any level. 

The main thing Sagebox does is to let you write C/C++ programs in Windows as easy as a scripting language or console-mode program.  Sagebox also supports canonical, full-on event-driven programming. 

Sagebox helps keep it creative while also providing a package where you can build professional and commercial applications.

On the other hand, most of the time we just want to develop without having to split our program into pieces to support an event-driven environment or deal with UI interfacing just to put up a test button we may only use once and then remove.

See the examples in the Examples directory -- some are very easy, while others take advantage of more advanced functions.   Also see the videos on the Youtube Page (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuDgFsVzpijnUmdVZ99w2VA) that show starting simple procedural programs with Sagebox, all the way to working with advanced event-driven programs. 

Sagebox Alpha

This is the Alpha release.  It is stable and works well.  It just needs more functions.  The Alpha Release is about listening to you -- let me know what you like and what you want.  The next year is all about making Sagebox work for you, because I wrote it for people to have fun with programming.

Sagebox exists on donations.  See the donation page at: http://projectsagebox.com/DonatePaypal.html
