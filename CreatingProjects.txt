Creating and Adapting Projects to Use the Sagebox Library
---------------------------------------------------------

There are two methods to create and use projects with the Sagebox libraries. 

	1. Use the .ZIP project templates in "MSVC Project Templates"
	2. Specify paths in your new or existing project (this can also be used for existing 
	   console-mode, i.e. non-Windows, projects).

Paths
-----

There are two primary paths: 

	* include
	* lib

Include Path
------------

The only requirement is to have a path to the include directory where "CSagebox.H" resides.  This is where 
all needed Sagebox .H files are kept. With Microsoft projects, you can set an additional include path. 

Lib Path
--------

The other path is the .LIB path where the x32 and x64 Sagebox libraries reside.  Alternatively, these 
libraries can be copied into an already-default path. The WinMain.Lib file is also necessary when 
creating an automatic Windows generation -- i.e. where you can use a regular main() but create it as a 
Windows program.  This will be discussed in another document, but is currently a project option in the .ZIP 
files in the "MSVC Project Templates" in the main project directory. 

Microsoft Visual C++ Templates
------------------------------

There are a number of .ZIP files in the project directory "MSVC Project Templates".  
These can be unzipped into the path "\users\<your account>\document\Visual Studio 2019\Templates". 
After this, these can be used to load any of the projects. 

Directory Structure for Templates

The current templates need the following directory structure
	<main directory>
		<include> 		(Sagebox include files)
		<lib>			(Sagebox Library files>
		<Widgets>		(Optional Widgets directory)
		<My Projects> 		(Your main project directory)
			<Project or Solution> 		(The actual project or solution)

For example, if you are creating a project or solution called "Rob's Sagebox Project" in a directory 
structure "Rob's MSVC Projects", the directory path for the required Sagebox paths are as follows:
	
	./Rob's MSVC Projects/include			-- Sagebox includes
	./Rob's MSVC Projects/lib			-- Sagebox library files
	./Rob's MSVC Projects/Rob's Sagebox Project	-- Project or solution main directory.

The Sagebox project directory "My Projects" may be used to place projects using the .ZIP project
templates, or the include, lib, and other directories can be copied into the same relative place from your 
project in order to use the templates.
